    <h1>3D Modeling as a Hobby</h1>
    <main class="col-12">
      <p>by Stephen Ziegler. Made for CS 2350.</p>
      <p>
        Of all the possible hobbies to have, 3D modeling sounds like one of the
        more esoteric ones. It's like someone saying that they study neural
        proteins in their spare time, or that they decompress after a hard day of
        work by launching up the old particle accelerator in the garage. One
        reason for this might be how broad the field of 3D modeling is. In fact,
        referring to all 3D work on a computer as "3D modeling" is inaccurate. A
        more accurate thing to refer to it as would be "Using 3D Computer Graphics
        Technologies and Processes to Create Artistic Works," but that doesn't
        really roll off the tongue, so I'll stick with the former. Some of the
        subtypes of work in 3D computer graphics can include...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Modeling</li>
        <li>Texturing/Material Creation</li>
        <li>Rigging</li>
        <li>Animation</li>
        <li>Rendering</li>
        <li>Compositing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Another reason that 3D modeling sounds like a strange thing to have as a
        hobby might be the prohibitive cost. Not only do you need a computer with
        a decent CPU and a high-caliber graphics card, but you also need a 3D
        computer graphics software tool set (as Wikipedia calls them), many of
        which are only available through subscriptions touting amounts equivalent
        to the aforementioned computer you need to run them. For example, the
        industry standard program for VFX work 
        <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview"
        target="_blank"
        title="Visit the overview page of Maya">
          Maya by Autodesk
        </a>
        costs $1,785 per year for a software license as of writing this.
        Additional programs to do specific tasks such as cloth simulation or
        material design may also be in the hundreds to thousands of dollars. But
        one program breaks that mold, and that program is...

      <p>
        Blender is a fully fleshed out "3D creation suite" (as they refer to
        themselves as). It hosts tools for 3D modeling, texturing, motion capture,
        virtual reality, and everything in between. What makes it different though
        is not its toolkit, but its pricing and development model. Blender is both
        free and open-source. You can download it right now and have access to
        every single feature it offers. Not only that, but the program is actually
        yours. What do I mean by that? Blender is licensed using the 
        <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html"
        target="_blank"
        title="View the GPL license">
          GPL
        </a>
        . The GPL, or GNU Public License is one that guarantees four
        freedoms: Freedom to run, study, share, and modify. Unlike Maya where the
        program is only ever temporarily licensed to you and revokable at any
        time, Blender allows you to share copies of it freely, and modify your
        copy of it however you see fit. This "freedom to modify" is exercised and
        concentrated to push development of the program forward, essentially
        crowd-sourcing the software development process. This crazy, public style
        of development and distribution doesn't sound like it should work, but it
        did for Blender.

          <th>
            Steps 1 and 2, initial setup of scene and materials.
          </th>
          <td class="textCell">
            1. Setting up a simple scene. This one uses easily-accessible
            "primitive mesh" objects that come prepackaged with the software.
            Basic shapes like cubes, cylinders, cones, spheres, and the mascot of
            Blender: Suzanne, in the form of a monkey head mesh.

          <td class="textCell">
            2. Applying materials to each object in our scene. The difference
            between materials and textures is a little confusing. A way to put it
            might be that textures are an ingredient to 3D materials. Textures
            provide raw color and detail data while materials more define rules on
            how light should interact with the object.

          </th>
          <td class="textCell">
            3. Finalizing mesh shading and choosing a background. Notice how the
            cylinder and our friend Suzanne appear smoothed. This is achieved
            using graphical tricks rather than pure mesh subdivision, as a
            perfectly smooth object would require an infinite amount of memory to
            represent. Some amount of subdivision does occur though. As for the
            background, it's a 360 degree photo of a real-world location. This is
            done to provide accurate lighting and reflection to the "fake" objects
            in the scene, as half the battle of 3D texturing and materials is how
            the objects are lit.

            4. A scene camera is added to tell the computer what should actually
            be rendered. After setting a few parameters, the process of rendering
            begins. You'll notice that while the previous picture shows decent
            reflections, no objects are casting shadows and the image looks
            relatively flat. That's because those images are displayed using an
            intermediate "material view" that Blender provides, which has
            rendering techniques closer to the tricks used by video game engines
            rather than accurate path-tracing engines. On the other hand, the
            rendered version uses Blender's "Cycles" path-tracing engine to
            simulate a fairly accurate approximation of how real-world light and
            its physics would interact with these objects. The result is
            photorealistic-looking shadows, reflections, refractions, and
            diffusion.

            caustics are faintly visible in the monkey head's shadow."
