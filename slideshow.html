            This is a macro photograph of a microfiber

            must've been feeling creative that day.

          <h2>Info</h2>
          <p>
            These are all photographs I took at some point that I thought were
            interesting enough to display here. They were taken with a Canon
            PowerShot SX530 HS. It has up to 50x optical zoom and wireless/NFC
            capabilities integrated into it. Besides that, it's not that much
            different than a cheap(er) point-and-shoot camera. For example, it
            doesn't have a view finder, only a digital display. On a spectrum of
            camera grades, it would sit in the middle of point-and-shoot style
            cameras and heavy-weight DSLR (Digital Single-Lens Reflex) cameras.
            Cameras that sit in that range are called "bridge" cameras, because
            they bridge the gap between the two extremes. The SX530 is lacking
            when it comes to its aperture range and ISO settings, but its manual
            mode still allows for some creative control when necessary. The
            extreme amount of zoom the camera is capable of creates 
            opportunities for photographs which would otherwise require very
            expensive telescopic lenses to capture.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for the pictures themselves, they were taken at the highest
            quality setting allowable by the camera. Their lighting was slightly
            adjusted and the color saturation was somewhat boosted on a few of
            them. To prepare them for the web, they were downscaled to 600x450,
            and compressed with a 95% JPEG quality setting. As a note about the
            caption of the last picture, the image sensor of any digital camera
            can be damaged by the sun if exposed for even seconds, as the lens
            of the camera focuses the sunlight into a tight beam, which is then
            directed at the Charged Couple Device or Complementary Metal-Oxide
            Semiconductor. Similarly to anything on the other end of a properly
            adjusted magnifying glass on a sunny day, this is not good for the
            internals of your camera. However, SLR-type cameras redirect all
            light through their viewfinders, only exposing their film or image
            sensor for however long the shutter speed is set to open. So while
            one should avoid looking into an SLR's viewfinder at the sun,
            pictures "fired from the hip" can still be taken without too much
            risk to the camera itself.
