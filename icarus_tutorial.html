    <h1>Icarus Publishing Tutorial</h1>
    <main class="col-12">
      <p>
        This page will provide a tutorial on how to host or "publish" a website
        on Weber State University's Icarus server. Icarus is what WSU calls the
        Linux server it hosts for computer science students. This tutorial assumes
        that you're using the Microsoft Windows operating system.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will need three things before we begin:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Your website's HTML files and resources</li>
        <li>
          Your Icarus login credentials (username and password)
        </li>
        <li>
          An SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) client
          <ul>
            <li>
              I will be using WinSCP for this. It's only compatible with Windows
            </li>
            <li>
              If you're on a Mac, Cyberduck is the WSU recommended alternative
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Instructions for Icarus login credentials and SFTP clients can be found at
        <a href="https://www.weber.edu/CS/remote-access.html"
        target="_blank"
        title="Go to Weber State University's remote access information page">
          WSU's remote access</a>
        info page.
      </p>

      <h2>Uploading a Website</h2>
      <p>
        Step 1. Open your SFTP client. This tutorial will specifically use WinSCP.
        Once you open it, under all the toolbars on the left you should see a
        reflection of some location on your computer. On the right will be a blank
        panel. This blank panel will show the files and folders of your portion
        of the Icarus server once a session is established.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 2. Open a session with the WSU Icarus server by clicking the
        "Session" button on the top toolbar, and then clicking "New Session...".
      </p>

      a button titled New Session" 
      width="375"
      height="77">
      <p>
        Step 3. A login window will pop up. Ensure that the file protocol is set
        to "SFTP". Next, enter the address "icarus.cs.weber.edu" (without quotes)
        into the field labeled "Host name". Thirdly, set the "Port number" field
        to 22. Finally, enter your Icarus username and password into the
        respective fields. When you've entered all of that info, WinSCP will allow
        you to save that login information for later ease of access by clicking
        the "Save" button. Otherwise, you can choose to simply proceed by clicking
        the "Login" button with the green icon. Below is an image of the relevant
        fields with the proper file protocol, host name, and port number set.
      </p>
      <img src="resources/images/icarus_tutorial_images/winscp_login.png"
      alt="A cropped portion of the WinSCP Login panel. It shows a drop-down menu
      labeled File protocol, a field labeled Host name, a field labeled Port
      number, and a username and password entry field. A save button and advanced
      options button is below that."
      width="353"
      height="206">
      <p>
        Step 4. The right panel should open to your home folder on the Icarus
        server. If you haven't ever used it before, you should only see a
        "public_html" folder and an "up one directory" folder icon (with the name
        ".."). The latter is just a navigation button, not a real folder.
      </p>
      <img src="resources/images/icarus_tutorial_images/winscp_open_session.png"
      alt="A picture of a new user's default Icarus directory."
      width="267"
      height="105">
      <p>
        Step 5. Double-click the "public_html" folder to open it. As a rule of
        thumb, anything placed inside the "public_html" folder will be publicly
        accessible by anyone with the proper URL. Anything outside of it will only
        be accessible by you and you alone (assuming no one else has your login
        credentials).
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 6. To upload a file or folder to Icarus, you will need to locate it
        in the left panel (which represents your own computer's file system). If
        you don't know where to start looking, a filepath to a location familiar
        to many is "C:\Users\[YOUR USERNAME]\Documents", which is your local
        documents folder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 7. Once you've located your website files, you can upload them by
        clicking and dragging them from the left panel to the right.. Clicking and
        dragging over a file uploads that singular file. Clicking and dragging
        over a folder will upload that folder and all of its contents. To upload
        multiple files at once, you will need to create a selection first. You can
        either box-select items, use shift-key selection for consecutive items, or
        ctrl-key selection for non-consecutive items. After your selection is
        complete, click and drag them over or use the "Upload" button at the top
        left of the panel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 8. One last upload confirmation window might appear. You can leave
        all of the settings as their defaults and simply click the "OK" button.
        Your upload will commence and your files will be on the remote server
        after completion.

      <h2>How to Compose a URL</h2>
      <p>
        After your website is uploaded to your public_html folder, you'll still
        need to craft the URL to access it from a web browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 1. All URLs for websites hosted on Icarus will begin with the Icarus
        domain name. That is: "icarus.cs.weber.edu". This is the beginning of your
        URL.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 2. Next, all URLs for websites uploaded by you will have your
        username placed after a forward slash and a tilde character (~). Using
        "YourUserName" as we have in previous examples, your new URL would be
        "icarus.cs.weber.edu/~YourUserName". This URL is technically pointing
        directly at your public_html folder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step 3. All that's left now is to fill in the filepath to point towards
        the .html file you want the user to load when they enter this URL into
        their web browser. 3 examples follow for how to compose the last part of
        your URL for different situations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Situation 1: You have an .html file sitting directly in your public_html
        directory. Type the name and extension of your .html file after your
        initial URL and a forward slash.
      </p>
      <img src="resources/images/icarus_tutorial_images/situation1.png"
      alt="A file named website.html sitting in the public_html directory."
      width="303"
      height="85">
      <p>
        Finished example URL: icarus.cs.weber.edu/~YourUserName/website.html
      </p>
      <p>
        Situation 2: You have an .html file within a subfolder named
        "site_folder" inside your public_html directory. Type the folder name
        before you type the file name and extension, all separated by forward 
        slashes.
      </p>
      <img src="resources/images/icarus_tutorial_images/situation2.png"
      alt="A file named website.html within a subfolder called site_folder
      within the public_html directory"
      width="306"
      height="153">
      <p>
        Finished example URL:
        icarus.cs.weber.edu/~YourUserName/site_folder/website.html
      </p>
      <p>
        Situation 3: You have an "index.html" file in your public_html
        directory. HTML files with the name "index" are special since browsers
        will look for them and load them when they're given a URL that only
        points to a folder without specifying a file. If you don't specify an
        .html file in your URL, your browser will look for index.html and load
        it if it finds it.
      </p>
      <img src="resources/images/icarus_tutorial_images/situation3.png"
      alt="A file named index.html within the public_html directory."
      width="202"
