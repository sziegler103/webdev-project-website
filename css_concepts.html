          The CSS Box Model. By Matthias Apsel, CC0,

        </p>
        <p>
          The CSS Box model contains 4 major parts:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Content</li>
            <li>Padding</li>
            <li>Border</li>
            <li>Margin</li>
          </ul>
        <p>
          Content is whatever you want to actually display, whether that be text
          or image data. Imagining an actual box that you'd ship something in,
          content would be the item that you're shipping. Padding is space between
          the content and the border. You can think of it like packing material.
          The border is a line that separates padding and margin. Think of it like
          the actual cardboard edges of our analogous box. Finally, margin is the
          amount of space between the border of the current element and other
          elements, or in our analogy, how much room we allow between boxes. We
          will elaborate on padding and margin in the upcoming section.
        </p>
        <h3>Padding</h3>
        <p>
          Padding adds space between the inner content and outer edges of an
          element. If an element has a defined width or height, the content within
          that element will fill to that width or height, and then padding will
          add space beyond that.
        </p>
        <div id="padDiv1">
          Uniform padding, 20px for top, bottom, and sides. Our element has a
          defined width of 400px, so the text will stretch to that size (or fill
          it with whitespace), and then padding will be added on beyond it.
        </div>
        <div id="padDiv2">
          Alternating padding, top and bottom have 40px of padding, left side and
          right side have a padding of 20px. Notice the extra space between the
          top and bottom of the box compared to the top and bottom of the area the
          text fills.
        </div>
        <div id="padDiv3">
          Varied padding. All sides have differing padding amounts. 80px for top,
          60px for right side, 40px for bottom, 20px for left side. This
          convoluted padding style makes the text appear to be in the bottom left
          of our box.
        </div>
        <h3>Margin</h3>
        <div id="margDiv1">
          Default margin setting. Hypothetically, this element has a margin size
          of 0px. However, most browsers set the &lt;body&gt; to have a small
          default margin size, which this element inherits from. The size of this
          implicit margin varies by how your specific browser implements it.
        </div>
        <div id="margDiv2">
          Left margin set to 40px. Notice how our gray box appears to have been
          nudged to the right. You can imagine an invisible box 40px wide and of
          an equivalent height to this element sitting in the space that is now
          displacing this text box.
        </div>
        <div id="margDiv3">
          Left margin set to 100px. This is just like the previous example, but
          with a larger number. Now you can imagine that we've asked for a 100px
          invisible box to sit on the left side of this element and displace it.
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Style Changes on Hover</h2>
        <p>
          To "hover" over an element means to move your mouse cursor over its
          content, padding, or border. Resting your mouse cursor over an element's
          associated margin does not count as hovering. While the user is hovering
          over some element, we can ask the browser to respond in some way through
          HTML or CSS. You've already seen this done through the use of the
          HTML "title" attribute showing a small tooltip when a user mouses over
          an element it's applied to (such as a link). Now, with CSS you can do
          many more things of that nature.
        </p>
        <div id="hoverDiv1">
          This element will not change when you hover over it. Think of it as our
          control case.
        </div>
        <div id="hoverDiv2">
          This element will change color when you hover over it over the course of
          4 seconds.
        </div>
        <div id="hoverDiv3">
          This element will change its width when you hover over it. Notice how
          the text automatically adjusts.
        </div>
      </section>

        <h2>Color Contrast</h2>
        <p>
          The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standard setting body created an
          accessibility standard dubbed WCAG, which stands for Web Content
          Accessibility Guidelines. Part of those guidelines go over color
          contrast, rating the differences between text color and its background.
          While calculating color contrast ratios is beyond the scope of this
          page, it boils down to two ratings: AA and AAA. The WCAG double-A rating
          requires (among other things) a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for
          normal-sized text. The WCAG triple-A rating requires a contrast ratio of
          at least 7:1 for normal-sized text. The following table will show a few
          examples.
        </p>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Text</th>
            <th>Background Color</th>

        <h2>Position</h2>
        <p>
          The position property affects how elements are placed on a webpage.
          We will cover three types: Relative, Absolute, and Fixed position.
        </p>
        <h3>Relative Position</h3>
        <div class="examplePageBorder">
          The dark gray box is an element with relative positioning and offsets of
          400px to the right and 50px upwards. First of all, notice the
          <div class="exampleBox" id="box1"></div>
          empty space the box leaves in the spot it would be if it were not
          offset. If you put your mouse within the black border to simulate the
          window changing size, notice how the box moves downwards with its "ghost
          position."
        </div>
        <p class="imageCaption">
          Hover over the text to watch the box move relative to its original
          position.
        </p>
        <h3>Absolute Position</h3>
        <div class="examplePageBorder" id="ancestorPage">
          <div class="exampleBox" id="box2"></div>
          This box has absolute positioning. This means that instead of being
          positioned relative to where it would be otherwise, it's positioned
          absolutely according to the closest ancestor it has with an explicitly
          set position. If it can't find an ancestor with an explicitly set
          position, it will fall back to the body and be positioned according to
          that instead. Luckily for us, our gray box is nested inside of the div
          creating the black outline, so it's positioned according to that
          instead. Notice how absolutely positioned elements don't leave behind a
          "ghost" element where they should be.
        </div>
        <p class="imageCaption">
          Hovering over this box to simulate a page-resize won't move this gray
          box. Absolutely positioned elements are strictly positioned to the
          top-left of the element they're stuck to.
        </p>
        <h3>Fixed Position</h3>
        <p>
          Fixed position will position an element according to the user's screen
          instead of according to any element on the page. This would be annoying
          to demonstrate here, since it would be like putting a sticky-note on
          your monitor. An animated .webp might do the trick though.
        </p>

        <h2>Shadows</h2>
        <p>
          Text shadows and box shadows can be applied to various elements to give
          your webpage a sense of depth and to draw attention to certain things.
          An example of box-shadow property follows.
        </p>

        <h3>Horizontal Property</h3>
        <div class="shadowBox" id="sbox1"></div>
        <div class="shadowBox" id="sbox2"></div>
        <p>
          Box shadows can be positioned relative to the element they're applied
          to. These examples show a black shadow positioned by varying degrees to
          the right of a red box with an orange border.
        </p>
        <h3>Vertical Property</h3>
        <div class="shadowBox" id="sbox3"></div>
        <div class="shadowBox" id="sbox4"></div>
        <p>
          Shadows can also be positioned vertically relative to the element that
          they are applied to. This example shows 2 boxes, one with a shadow
          adjusted vertically by 20px, another by 40px.
        </p>
        <h3>Blur Property</h3>
        <div class="shadowBox" id="sbox5"></div>
        <div class="shadowBox" id="sbox6"></div>
        <p>
          Finally, shadows can be blurred to varying degrees. Here, the shadows
          are directly under their applied element but blurred to varying degrees.
